This program uses Python with beautifulsoup3 to scrape upcoming CS2 pro matches from [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Liquipedia:Matches). I would eventually like to make this into a discord bot that posts once a day with the games for that specific day. 


Before running please ensure to make sure you have the proper pip packages by running:

pip install discord

pip install requests

pip install beautifulsoup4
