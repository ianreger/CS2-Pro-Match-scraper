# 2. Technical Specifications:

Language: Python

beautifulsoup4: For web scraping with Liquipedia
requests (optional): If Liquipedia's structure changes and direct fetching becomes necessary

# 3. Functionality Breakdown:

## A. Data Retrieval:

The bot uses requests (optional) to fetch the Liquipedia CS:GO page content or directly parses the HTML using Beautiful Soup.
It utilizes Beautiful Soup to navigate the HTML structure and locate the section containing today's matches (might involve finding specific elements with class names or IDs).
The bot extracts relevant information from each match listing, such as:
Teams playing
Tournament name
Match time (including time zone)
Stream link s

- Deployed on Windows Server

# 6. Disclaimer:

* Liquipedia's website structure might change over time, requiring adjustments to the scraping logic.
* I respect Liquipedia's robots.txt and terms of service.
* I have thoroughly tested the bot with various match listings to ensure accuracy
